# AiPedia ExecPlans

An ExecPlan is required for significant work. It is a living implementation plan that Codex must keep updated while working.

## When required

Use an ExecPlan for major features, refactors, migrations, page-template rebuilds, SEO/schema changes, analytics systems, Tool Set Builder work, homepage/category/comparison redesigns, any task touching many files, or any work that changes multiple child pages under one top-layer section.

## Rules

The ExecPlan must be self-contained. A future Codex session with only the repo and this plan must understand what is being built, why it matters, what files are affected, how to verify it, and what “done” means.

Do not write vague plans. Every plan must include concrete files, components, data models, commands, QA gates, and acceptance criteria.

Every ExecPlan that touches child pages must include a top-layer maintenance pass. Identify the affected homepage modules, section indexes, parent category pages, archive pages, comparison/category/guide hubs, sitemap/llms surfaces, navigation, and internal-link blocks before coding. Before the plan is complete, verify those parent surfaces are updated, accurate, and not weaker or staler than the sub-pages they summarize.

## Required structure

### 1. Objective

Describe the user/business goal in plain English. Tie it to AiPedia’s mission: rankings, trust, mobile UX, affiliate conversion, maintainability, or editorial scalability.

### 2. Current state

Document what exists now after inspecting the repo. Include relevant files, routes, components, data structures, tests, and known issues.

### 3. Target state

Describe the desired behavior and user experience. Include mobile and desktop expectations.

### 4. Scope

List what is included and excluded.

Include affected top-layer pages, parent hubs, archive pages, navigation surfaces, sitemap/llms surfaces, and internal-link blocks when the work changes sub-pages or records they summarize.

### 5. Files likely affected

List exact files or directories. Update this during implementation.

### 6. Data model impact

Explain changes to tool data, category data, comparison data, affiliate data, source data, scoring data, or analytics payloads.

### 7. SEO impact

Explain title/meta/canonical/schema/internal-link/indexing effects.

### 8. Conversion impact

Explain CTA placements, affiliate tracking, disclosure, and revenue events.

### 9. Mobile UX impact

Explain how the change behaves at 360, 390, 430, 768, and desktop widths.

### 10. Implementation steps

Use ordered, verifiable steps. Each step should produce a working intermediate state where possible.

### 11. Verification commands

List exact commands to run, such as lint, typecheck, tests, build, page audit, link checker, schema test, or Playwright screenshots.

### 12. Acceptance criteria

Define what must be true before the work can be considered done.

Include a top-layer maintenance criterion whenever child pages were changed: affected parent hubs and archives must be current, internally linked, SEO-aligned, and verified against the changed child pages.

### 13. Risks and mitigations

List possible regressions and how to avoid them.

### 14. Progress log

Update after each major step with date/time, change summary, commands run, and results.

### 15. Final report

Summarize changed files, behavior shipped, tests passed, unresolved risks, and recommended next task.
